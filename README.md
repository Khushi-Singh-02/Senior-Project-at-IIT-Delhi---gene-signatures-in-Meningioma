I am currently working on my senior project on brain cancer with Prof. Ritu Kulshreshtha, Head of the Depratment of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology at IIT Delhi.
I have performed bioinformatics analyses on AIIMS patient RNA sequencing data to identify a ceRNA axis of interest in meningioma pathogenesis. I have prepared an overexpression
construct for the downregulated microRNA and used it to transfect the IOMM Lee cell line. I will now perform cell-based assays for cancer hallmarks like migration, proliferation
and apoptosis for functional validation of this axis.
